    Description: from

    This story will expose a feed of changes that are made to list price sets in Mercury that can be consumed by any interested party but, for now, the consumer will be the mercury-pseeker-adapter. It is expected that the feed will conform to the HAL specification. This will become more of a factor in later stages when the feed is paginated but will also provide a structure to represent the data.

    The complete set of changes will consist of an entry for every list price that has ever been entered into Mercury. Each entry will contain the following data:
        timestamp
        list price set id
        location uuid
        price

    To avoid having to integrate with Locations to resolve a location uuid to a suburb, state and postcode and because

        price

    To avoid having to integrate with Locations to resolve a location uuid to a suburb, state and postcode, the feed will embed the location details that Mercury has in its cache. This is also necessary because it is likely that Mercury will be privy to location changes before they are published by the Locations API.
