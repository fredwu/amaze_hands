    Description: from

    As a Pricer I want deprecated locations to be removed from the LPS download so I no longer need to price them
    to

    As a Pricer I want deprecated locations to be removed from the LPS download so I no longer need to price them

    This story would not include any sort of interface beyond a task that can process an input file. The focus is on the import logic that assesses the contents of the file and removes any locations known to Mercury but no longer appearing in the file. Considerations must be given to:
        what data must be retained when a location is "removed"
        what information needs to be recorded about the "removal"

    What we know is that:
        it should still be possible to search for deprecated suburbs in Mercury to lookup historical pricing
