    - We have a few approaches to handling errors currently in the system. Lets choos an approach and refactor the system for consistency.

    1. Service objects return success or failure to the controller. Controller decides where to route and to display an error message

    2. We let exceptions bubble up to the controller and we catch them there then we route and display message

    3. Potential option; we create a exception handler concern and mix it into the application controller. Exception handler rescues the particular exception and delegates to the private method. Exception handler would need to decide on the error message and route to the appropriate page.
