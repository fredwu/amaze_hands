Amaze Hands is an amazing tool developed for analysing Kanban board cards, in a similar fashion to poker [hands](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_poker_terms#hand) analysis.

Developed initially for the amazing Pricing squad in Group Platform at [REA](http://www.rea-group.com/), and now being used by the Pricing and Products squads.

## Why?

_Lorem ipsum spreadsheet amaze._

Previously, as a [Delivery Lead](https://www.google.com.au/search?tbm=isch&q=spreadsheet+slave) I spent a significant portion of my time manually recording card dates and working out the cycle time and wait time. LeanKit unfortunately does not help much - its reporting tool is very basic and somewhat inaccurate.

Below is the spreadsheet I used - Excel formulas are helpful, but punching in dates is an extremely tedious process.

## Amaze Hands to the Rescue

__The goal of Amaze Hands is to incrementally add intelligence to our agile process.__

By incrementally adding and/or filtering data points for analysis, we will be able to zero in on the problematic areas of our agile process. The following is a list of potential areas we could perform analysis on:

- cycle time
- wait time
- blocked time
- knocked-back time
- context switch (between different streams of work)
- other factors such as meetings, attrition, etc

## How?

_Lorem ipsum copy paste amaze._

Even though LeanKit does offer an XML export function for exporting card history, the function is broken therefore Amaze Hands relies on copy-pasted card history text from each card to process the data and generate metrics.

Below is a high level system architecture diagram that shows how Amaze Hands handles data.

## Supported Kanban Boards

Amaze Hands out of the box has parser and transformer strategies for the following tools:

- [LeanKit](http://leankit.com/)
- CSV

## Stack

Amaze Hands is proudly built with:

- Ruby 2.1+
- [Lotus](http://lotusrb.org/)
- [Parslet](http://kschiess.github.io/parslet/) for [PEG](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing_expression_grammar)
- [C3.js](http://c3js.org/)
- [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
- [RUI](http://rea.to/rui)

## How to Use

### Run Metrics in CLI

```
bundle install
lotus c
```

```ruby
# in lotus repl
Workflow.new(
  strategy: Strategies::LeanKit,
  lanes:    Strategies::LeanKit::PricingLanes,
  files:    Dir["#{__dir__}/db/pricing/*.txt"]
).metrics
```

### Run Metrics in Local Web App

```
